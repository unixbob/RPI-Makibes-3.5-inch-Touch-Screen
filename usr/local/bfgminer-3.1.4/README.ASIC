SUPPORTED DEVICES

Currently supported ASIC devices include ASICMiner's Block Erupter USB miners,
Avalon, and Butterfly Labs' SC range of devices.

AVALON

Currently, Avalon boards are supported only by connecting them directly (or via
a hub) to a regular PC running BFGMiner. It is also possible to install the
OpenWrt packages of BFGMiner to the Avalon's embedded controller, but this is
not a simple task due to its lack of available flash space.

To use the Avalon from a regular PC, you will need to specify two options:
First, add the -S option specifying the avalon driver specifically. For example,

-S avalon:\\.\COM9

Next, use the --avalon-options copying the command as used by the internal
router used by the Avalon. eg:

--avalon-options 115200:24:10:45:282

The values are baud : miners : asic count : timeout : frequency.

Baud:
The device is pretty much hard coded to emulate 115200 baud so you shouldn't
change this.

Miners:
Most Avalons are 3 module devices, which come to 24 miners. 4 module devices
would use 32 here.

Asic count:
Virtually all have 10, so don't change this.

Timeout:
This is how long the device will work on a work item before accepting new work
to replace it. It should be changed according to the frequency (last setting).
It is possible to set this a little lower if you are trying to tune for short
block mining (eg p2pool) but much lower and the device will start creating
duplicate shares.

Sample settings for valid different frequencies (last 2 values):
34:375
36:350
39:325
43:300
45:282
47:270
50:256

Frequency:
This is the clock speed of the devices. Only specific values work, 256, 270,
282 (default), 300, 325, 350 and 375.

If you use the full curses based interface with Avalons you will get this
information:
AVA 0: 22/ 46C  60%/2400R

The values are:
ambient temp / highest device temp  set fan % / lowest detected fan RPM.

Use the API for more detailed information than this.
